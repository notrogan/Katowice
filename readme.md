## Getting Started
This is based off an older version of the original HUD by [drweissbrot](https://github.com/drweissbrot/cs-hud), so you will need to build the binaries yourself.

1. install yarn in the project directory
2. run `yarn package` to create an executable
3. add the included `.cfg` file to the cs game directory
4. run executable while cs is in `fullscreen windowed` mode

Note that in order for the HUD to work properly, there needs to be a `.svg` in the `teams` folder that matches the team name, otherwise the HUD will not show up.
